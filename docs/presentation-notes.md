- Networking (making request to external services)

    - React Native provides you with the Fetch API which is the same as in the browser.
    - React Native also provides has [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) so can use libraries that depend on that too
    - Also supports web sockets.
